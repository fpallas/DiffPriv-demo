For this purpose, we employ the python programming language and some broadly used packages. These are ensured to be installed above. In particular, this includes:\n",

Put briefly, such quasi-identifiers are values included in a dataset that still allow to re-identify the person behind the datapoint (at least with some certainty) because the combination is so rare in a given context that only one person actually exhibits it. [Sweeny (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5874809758453902851&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) provides the illustrative example of having been able to re-identify persons from insufficiently anonymized health data by simply mapping included combinations of ZIP-code, birthday, and sex against a public voter database.\n",

    "In our student example, a similar effect would, for instance, happen when the insufficiently anonymized dataset is made publicly available and when it is known by one party B (possibly a co-student of party A) that A participated in the course in their 14th semester. B could then conclude that A got a 1.3 in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just removing explicit identifiers from a dataset is thus obviously not enough. Instead, we also have to avoid \"uniqueness\" of de-personalized datapoints included in our dataset. In this regard, [Sweeny (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5874809758453902851&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) introduced the concept of *k*-anonymity. Put briefly, *k*-anonymity is about generalizing / abstracting data in such a way that some datapoints become indistinguishable based on the quasi-identifiers (this excludes those parts of the data that can legitimately assumed to not appear elsewhere -- in our case: the grades). Such generalization can be done by abstracting a birthday into a range of birth, cutting off digits from ZIP codes, etc. \n",

    "*k*-anonymity then means that each group of \"indistinguishable\" data points contains at least *k* entries. Several algorithms exist to *k*-anonymize data efficiently, but these shall not be considered in-depth herein. Let us, for illustrative purposes, assume that we somehow concluded what needs to be done to achieve a *k* of 3 for our example dataset: We just have to mask matriculation numbers and names and then group semesters of attendance into four clusters: Cluster 1 with semesters 4 and below, cluster 2 for semester 5, cluster 3 for semesters 6 to 9, and cluster 4 for semesters 10 and above. \n",

    "Put (very) briefly, differential privacy follows the idea of only releasing aggregate results of queries (such as means, sums, ...) on privacy-sensitive data and adding \"noise\" to these results in order to avoid the above-mentioned problem of similar queries being made to slightly differing datasets. Without deep-diving into the formal definitions (on this, see again [Wood et al. (2018)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5713053704431991604&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) or, even more formally, [Dwork and Roth (2014)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15281065433928134483&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)), differential privacy ensures that the probabilities p and p' for a certain query result to be returned for two datasets D and D' -- which only differ by the existence of one entry, such as studentX from our above example -- are very similar. The similarity of these probabilities, in turn, is defined by a parameter named epsilon. Again without deep-diving into the formal definitions etc., a lower epsilon means a higher similarity in the (randomized) distribution of results returned for D and D'. Low epsilons thus lead to a lower severity of above-sketched risks and, in the end, a higher level of privacy / anonymity.\n",

    "Confused? Understandable. Let's illustrate what happens based on our established student example again:\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustrating the application and the effects of differential privacy, we first need an implementation of said \"noising\" mechanisms or, more specifically, of an algorithm producing differentially private results. Luckily, we do not have to implement those algorithms ourself but can use a ready-made python-package: [PyDP](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP), which wraps [Google's Differential Privacy Suite](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) and makes it available in python. We thus import this package under the shortcut dp.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package offers different \"noising\" algorithms. Basically, each of them provably ensures that the formal definition for differential privacy is met. At the same time, however, we also want the produced query results to be as accurate as possible (otherwise, we could simply always return a static value such as ```42```, which would also fulfill the formal criteria for differential privacy). A Laplacian distribution of probabilities (at what probability will which result be returned) provides quite a good accuracy here. As we will only calculate differentially private mean values in the following, we thus import PyDP's BoundedMean function in the \"Laplacian flavor\". Before, however, we have to to some setup and initializations to allow starting right here:\n"
