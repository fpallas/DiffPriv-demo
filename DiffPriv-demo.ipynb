    "However, we still have so-called quasi-identifiers in this dataset. Put briefly, such quasi-identifiers are values included in a dataset that still allow to re-identify the person behind the datapoint (at least with some certainty) because the combination is so rare in a given context that only one person actually exhibits it. [Sweeny (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5874809758453902851&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) provides the illustrative example of having been able to re-identify persons from insufficiently anonymized health data by simply mapping included combinations of ZIP-code, birthday, and sex against a public voter database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our student example, a similar effect would, for instance, happen when the insufficiently anonymized dataset is made publicly available and when it is known by one party B (possibly a co-student of party A) that A participated in the course in their 14th semester. B could then conclude that A got a 1.3 in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just removing explicit identifiers from a dataset is thus obviously not enough. Instead, we also have to avoid \"uniqueness\" of de-personalized datapoints included in our dataset. In this regard, [Sweeny (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5874809758453902851&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) introduced the concept of *k*-anonymity. Put briefly, *k*-anonymity is about generalizing / abstracting data in such a way that some datapoints become indistinguishable based on the quasi-identifiers (this excludes those parts of the data that can legitimately assumed to not appear elsewhere -- in our case: the grades). Such generalization can be done by abstracting a birthday into a range of birth, cutting off digits from ZIP codes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "*k*-anonymity then means that each group of \"indistinguishable\" data points contains at least *k* entries. Several algorithms exist to *k*-anonymize data efficiently, but these shall not be considered in-depth herein. Let us, for illustrative purposes, assume that we somehow concluded what needs to be done to achieve a *k* of 3 for our example dataset: We just have to mask matriculation numbers and names and then group semesters of attendance into four clusters: Cluster 1 with semesters 4 and below, cluster 2 for semester 5, cluster 3 for semesters 6 to 9, and cluster 4 for semesters 10 and above. \n",

Due to *k*-anonymization, we cannot identify A's datapoint in the dataset. However, we can -- due to the specific distribution in the dat at hand -- still say that, knowing that semester 14 is in group 4, A must either have received a 1.3 or a 1.0, which both boil down to a 1. \n",

Beyond *k*-anonymity, *l*-diversity requires that generalization/aggregation is consucted in such a way that each of the resulting clusters / groups contains at least *l* different sensitive values (in our case: grades). \n",

We then again generate a (second) *l*-diverse representation and again hand it over to the \"student success officer\":"

    "## Enter Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ideas and concepts behind differential privacy can hardly be explained in a few lines. A quite conceivable introduction has, for instance, been given by [Wood et al. (2018)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5713053704431991604&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Put (very) briefly, differential privacy follows the idea of only releasing aggregate results of queries (such as means, sums, ...) on privacy-sensitive data and adding \"noise\" to these results in order to avoid the above-mentioned problem of similar queries being made to slightly differing datasets. Without deep-diving into the formal definitions (on this, see again [Wood et al. (2018)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5713053704431991604&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) or, even more formally, [Dwork and Roth (2014)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15281065433928134483&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)), differential privacy ensures that the probabilities p and p' for a certain query result to be returned for two datasets D and D' -- which only differ by the existence of one entry, such as studentX from our above example -- are very similar. The similarity of these probabilities, in turn, is defined by a parameter named epsilon. Again without deep-diving into the formal definitions etc., a lower epsilon means a higher similarity in the (randomized) distribution of results returned for D and D'. Low epsilons thus lead to a lower severity of above-sketched risks and, in the end, a higher level of privacy / anonymity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused? Understandable. Let's illustrate what happens based on our established student example again:\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustrating the application and the effects of differential privacy, we first need an implementation of said \"noising\" mechanisms or, more specifically, of an algorithm producing differentially private results. Luckily, we do not have to implement those algorithms ourself but can use a ready-made python-package: [PyDP](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP), which wraps [Google's Differential Privacy Suite](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) and makes it available in python. We thus import this package under the shortcut dp.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package offers different \"noising\" algorithms. Basically, each of them provably ensures that the formal definition for differential privacy is met. At the same time, however, we also want the produced query results to be as accurate as possible (otherwise, we could simply always return a static value such as ```42```, which would also fulfill the formal criteria for differential privacy). A Laplacian distribution of probabilities (at what probability will which result be returned) provides quite a good accuracy here. As we will only calculate differentially private mean values in the following, we thus import PyDP's BoundedMean function in the \"Laplacian flavor\". Before, however, we have to to some setup and initializations to allow starting right here:\n"

    "As we see, the differentially private (\"noised\") results spread across the whole spectrum of available grades but in most cases revolve around the actual mean of respective datasets. We can thus say that \"in most cases, results are 'quite' accurate\" -- exactly what we intended by introducing the laplacian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, however, result probabilities between both dataset differ a bit. This results from the epsilon value we used. Given above explanations, what can we thus expect from setting different values for epsilon and re-plotting the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we can expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "* lower epsilons (such as 0.2 or 0.1) will lead to both histograms being less distinguishable (producing higher cross-dataset privacy / anonymity) but at the same time produce less \"spiky\" distibutions around the actual mean (and, thus, a lower accuracy of provided results)\n",
    "* higher epsilons (such as 2.5), in turn, produce results more accurately reflecting actual means but lead to more distinguishable histograms, exposing studentX to the \"difference-attack\" initially mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "When playing around with different epsilons and executing the above code block for them, we see these assumptions to hold. For low epsilons -- which we want to have in order to provide higher epsilon-privacy -- the accuracy does, however, drop significantly and it becomes questionable whether they do actually provide value for analyses. This is mainly due to the very small size of our example dataset. Let us therefore inflate it a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Increasing Dataset Size\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effect of bigger datasets, let us first generate two new datasets by simply appending our initial one to itself without and with studentX included, respectively. We thus have one dataset simply including each data point from the initial one twice and one dataset that additionally includes student X. For these, we generate the same plots with the same value for epsilon as above:"

    "\n",
    "Let us assume an insurance use-case where customers' base and contract data as well as data about costs they caused are held some centralized, well-protected databases. Let us, assume that the product development or the marketing department is wondering whether customers that hold a bike-theft-insurance but no health insurance yet should be given special offers (assuming that bike holders a welcome health-insurance customers). However, providing the product development or marketing department with access to the internal database is nothing that could be thought of, given the sensitivity of data stored. providing raw aggregates is also not an optuion due to the possibility of difference attacks. However, we might think of differentially private queries again.\n",
